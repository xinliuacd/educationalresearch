This package matches your index.html and fixes the usual breaking points:
- Adds missing city SVG files (gothenburg/harbin/daqing) so images don't break.
- Adds assets/css/style.css so layout looks like the template.
- Adds placeholder pages with EXACT filenames in your nav (including spaces).

If you still see broken links, it is usually because the repo does not contain the page file with the same name.
