# Xin Liu — Diego-aligned single-page site (static)

This is a lightweight static site for GitHub Pages, aligned with the section naming & order used on diegocampos.co:
Home, About, Projects, Publications, Awards and Grants, Presentations, Teaching, Supervision, Academic Service, Contact.

## Edit content
- Main page: `index.html`
- Styling: `assets/css/style.css`

## Add your photo
1. Put your photo in `assets/images/` as `profile.jpg` (square works best).
2. In `index.html`, change:
   `src="assets/images/profile.svg"` -> `src="assets/images/profile.jpg"`
3. Commit + Push via GitHub Desktop.

## Deploy
Use GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → /(root)).
